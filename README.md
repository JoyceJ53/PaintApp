## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I plan to fix the different color buttons so they change color when the user clicks on them
* [ ] I plan on creating an app icon with a home screen on the app
* [ ] I plan on giving the app a footer/bottom bar that has buttons to undo, redo, and clear the screen
* [ ] I want to change the display code (it uses a never ending loop and is super laggy)
